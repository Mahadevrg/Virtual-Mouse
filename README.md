# Virtual-Mouse
AI Based Virtual Mouse is an AI-based project that allows users to access the mouse with hand gestures, without having to physically touch the mouse. This solution integrates a chatbot with a basic camera, rather than a traditional mouse, to handle mouse operations using user-friendly voice instructions.
